### Book

After selecting a book, users will be taken to the book details page. In one section, they'll see information for the book including title, year, author, and isbn in addition to an image cover (if available) provided by [Open Library](https://www.openlibrary.org/).

In another section, ratings for the book are displayed. This includes overall ratings for the book from this site as well as third-party [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). A list of submitted reviews on this site is also shown.

![book-details screen](.github/book-details.jpg?raw=true)

If no reviews for the book are shown, users will have the option to "Be the first", which focuses them on the review form.

![no reviews yet screen](.github/no-reviews-yet.jpg?raw=true)

### Review

Also on the book details page is the review form. On this site, stars corresponding to a 1-5 ranking are used, just to make things a little bit more fun 😎. Rating is required to submit, but text is optional.

![review form screen](.github/review-form.jpg?raw=true)

After submitting a review, the book page will re-load, showing their review first! And since only one rating per book per user is allowed, the user will be reminded of their rating in place of the review form.
